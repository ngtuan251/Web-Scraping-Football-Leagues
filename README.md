# __Web-Scraping-Football-Leagues__
---

In this project, I will use `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data of Top 5 European Leagues from a football webpage.

However, this data only contains statistics for every single games, so I will use `pandas` to aggregate them to statistics for every leagues.

The `FootballLeagues` csv file is the output of this program, which stores all the statistical information of the Top 5 European Leagues from the season of 2014.
